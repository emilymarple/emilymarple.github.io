I am an early-career ecologist driven by questions about how species interact and how those interactions shape ecological communities.
I graduated from Colorado College in May 2025 with distinction in Organismal Biology and Ecology, along with 2 minors in Environmental Studies and Race, Ethnicity, and Migration Studies. My positionality as a queer woman of color in STEM and through my academic background at the intersection of science and race studies, means I approach ecology with a deep awareness of how knowledge is shaped by who is included, heard, and supported.  I believe that science, and the communities it serves, are strongest when informed by diverse lived experiences and perspectives, a value that guides both my research path and my commitment to collaborative, inclusive scientific spaces. 
I currently work in the tropics at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) as a Global Sustainability Scholar and RaMP-UP Research Fellow. My research focuses on termite ecology and behavior, with an emphasis on predator–prey dynamics and how these relationships influence colony defense investments and carbon cycling.
