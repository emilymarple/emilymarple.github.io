    "text": "I am an early-career ecologist driven by questions about how species interact and how those interactions shape ecological communities. I graduated from Colorado College in May 2025 with distinction in Organismal Biology and Ecology, along with 2 minors in Environmental Studies and Race, Ethnicity, and Migration Studies. My positionality as a queer woman of color in STEM and through my academic background at the intersection of science and race studies, means I approach ecology with a deep awareness of how knowledge is shaped by who is included, heard, and supported. I believe that science, and the communities it serves, are strongest when informed by diverse lived experiences and perspectives, a value that guides both my research path and my commitment to collaborative, inclusive scientific spaces. I currently work in the tropics at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) as a Global Sustainability Scholar and RaMP-UP Research Fellow. My research focuses on termite ecology and behavior, with an emphasis on predator–prey dynamics and how these relationships influence colony defense investments and carbon cycling."

My research interests are broad, ranging in ecosystems and study species. Think lakes, deserts, birds, bees, butterflies, and now termites :) Outside of work, you can find me dancing, hiking, running, and learning how to play guitar. I love to move and create!"
